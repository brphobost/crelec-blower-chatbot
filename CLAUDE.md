2. **Products Database**: Static JSON file (needs manual updates)
3. **Calculations**: Basic model - see Advanced Calculator Development section below
4. **Admin Features**: No dashboard or analytics
5. **Stock Integration**: Manual stock status updates required

## üìã Planned Enhancements

## üîß Technical Stack

### Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla)
- jsPDF for PDF generation
- EmailJS for email sending (pending)
- Responsive design with mobile support

### Backend
- Python with FastAPI (serverless functions)
- SQLite for data storage
- JSON for product database

### Infrastructure
- GitHub for version control
- Vercel for hosting and auto-deployment
- Free tier services throughout

## üéØ Key Decisions & Learnings (Sept 28, 2025)

### 1. Multiple Blower Configurations = MASSIVE Energy Savings
- Discovered 51-91% energy savings possible with parallel configurations
- 3 small blowers use 83% less power than 1 large blower over daily cycle
- Affinity Laws: Power = Speed¬≥ (cubic relationship is key!)
- Payback period often < 1 year from energy savings alone

### 2. Altitude Corrections Are Critical for SA
- Johannesburg (1750m) requires 26% larger blowers than sea level
- Created comprehensive SA cities database with altitudes
- Automatic correction factors prevent undersized equipment

### 3. Chat Flow Must Match Existing Forms
- Users expect familiar order from paper forms
- Changed to match exact Crelec form: Operation ‚Üí Installation ‚Üí Altitude ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Dimensions
- Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load

### 4. Vercel Architecture Gotcha
- **LESSON LEARNED**: Vercel uses `/api/` folder for serverless functions
- `/api/chat.py` is production, `/backend/app.py` is development
- Must update BOTH files when changing logic
- Frontend can have fallback messages for resilience

### 5. Version Tracking Is Essential
- Added visible version number (bottom right) for deployment verification
- Helps identify caching issues immediately
- Update in 3 places: CLAUDE.md, index.html, widget.html

## üîÆ Next Priority Enhancements

### Immediate (High Impact)
1. **Display Configuration Comparison Table** in frontend
   - Show energy savings visually
   - Highlight recommended configuration
   - Include payback period

2. **Product Matching** to configurations
   - Map actual Crelec products to each configuration
   - Show 2√ó600m¬≥/hr vs 1√ó1200m¬≥/hr options

3. **PDF Quote Enhancement**
   - Include configuration comparison
   - Show energy savings calculations
   - Add installation type considerations

### Future Considerations
- Integration with Crelec's inventory system
- WhatsApp Business API for mobile users
- Historical quote tracking and follow-up

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: VERSION MANAGEMENT

### When Making Changes:
**ALWAYS UPDATE VERSION NUMBERS** in these locations:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Current Version section (line 6)
2. `frontend/index.html` - Version indicator (line 49)
3. `frontend/widget.html` - Version indicator (line 60)

### Version Numbering Scheme:
- **Major changes** (new features): v1.2.0 ‚Üí v1.3.0
- **Minor updates** (improvements): v1.1.0 ‚Üí v1.1.1
- **Bug fixes only**: v1.1.1 ‚Üí v1.1.2

### Example:
```bash
# After making changes, update all three files:
# CLAUDE.md: ## Current Version: v1.1.2
# index.html: <div class="version-indicator">v1.1.2</div>
# widget.html: <div style="...">v1.1.2</div>
```

## üî¨ Advanced Calculator Development (In Progress)

### Research Findings - Industry Standard Calculations

#### 1. **Critical Parameters from Crelec Form**
The existing Crelec form captures essential data:
- **Tank geometry**: Multiple tanks, series/parallel configurations
- **Pipe specifications**: Diameter, length, 90¬∞ bends
- **Environmental factors**: Altitude, temperature
- **Diffuser type**: 7x25mm galvanized pipes, 2mm holes, 400mm apart
- **Application specifics**: Depth, water type (wet/dusty/sea/gas)

#### 2. **Industry-Standard Calculation Methods**

**Wastewater Treatment:**
```
Pressure Required = Static Head + Friction Losses + Diffuser Loss
- Static Head = Depth(m) √ó 98.1 mbar/m
- Friction Loss = f √ó (L/D) √ó (œÅv¬≤/2)
- Diffuser Loss = 50-150 mbar (fine bubble)
```

**Aquaculture/Fish Farming:**
```
Airflow = Pond Area(m¬≤) √ó 0.0015-0.0025 m¬≥/min
Pressure = Depth(m) √ó 98.1 + 20-50 mbar (diffuser)
Oxygen Transfer: 1.3 kg O2/kWh under standard conditions
```

#### 3. **Missing Elements from Current Simple Calculator**
- **Oxygen Transfer Efficiency (SOTE)**: 2-6% for coarse, 15-25% for fine bubble
- **Alpha Factor**: 0.4-0.8 for wastewater (O2 transfer efficiency vs clean water)
- **Beta Factor**: 0.9-0.98 (O2 solubility in wastewater vs clean water)
- **Temperature Correction**: Œ∏^(T-20) factor for biological activity
- **Multiple Blower Interaction**: Parallel reduces pressure, series increases
- **Pipe Network Analysis**: Using Darcy-Weisbach equation
- **Diffuser Fouling Factor**: 1.5-2.0 over system lifetime

#### 4. **Manufacturer Specifications**
- **Goorui GHBH series**: 0-2400 m¬≥/h, 0-1000 mbar
- **Performance curves**: Tested at 15¬∞C, sea level
- **Altitude/temperature corrections**: Required for accurate selection
- **Sirocco models**: Similar range, different efficiency curves

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Vercel Deployment Structure
**IMPORTANT**: Vercel uses `/api/chat.py` as the serverless function endpoint, NOT `/backend/app.py`!
- `/api/chat.py` - This is what runs on Vercel production
- `/backend/app.py` - Local development server only
- Always update BOTH when changing chat flow logic

### Current Chat Flow (v1.5.1)
Streamlined for faster quotes:
1. **Operation Type** ‚Üí Compression or Vacuum
2. **Altitude** ‚Üí Location/city with smart detection
3. **Application** ‚Üí Waste Water, Fish Farm, Industrial
4. **Operational Data** ‚Üí Tank dimensions
5. **Results** ‚Üí Calculations with recommendations
6. **Email** ‚Üí Quote delivery
